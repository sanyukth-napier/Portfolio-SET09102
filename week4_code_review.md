# Code revie
```

class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // create a new invoice
        var invoice = new Invoice
        {
            InvoiceNo = 1,
            Customer = "John Doe",
            IssuedDate = new DateOnly(2023, 4, 1),
            Description = "Website Design",
            Amount = 1000,
            Tax = Amount * CURRENT_TAX_RATE
        };

        invoice.Save();

    }
}

```

## Problems
The code violates C# coding conventions.There is an undefined variable, The code attempts to calculate the tax using Amount * CURRENT_TAX_RATE, but there's no declaration 
or initialization of the Amount variable. The 'invoice.Amount' needs to be used  to access the 'Amount' property of the invoice object. The code is also missing class definitions. 
The code uses the Invoice class, but the definition of the Invoice class is not provided in the code snippet. The 'Save' method is also not defined is this code snippet. 
To follow standard conventions, the class should be defined with appropriate properties and methods.

## Improved Code

```

using System;

class Invoice
{
    // Properties of the Invoice class
    private int InvoiceNo { get; set; }        // Invoice number
    private string Customer { get; set; }      // Customer name
    private DateOnly IssuedDate { get; set; }  // Date when the invoice is issued
    private string Description { get; set; }   // Description of the invoice
    private decimal Amount { get; set; }       // Total invoice amount
    private decimal Tax { get; set; }          // Tax amount on the invoice

    // Method to save the invoice
    public void Save()
    {
        // Implementation to save the invoice
        Console.WriteLine($"Invoice {InvoiceNo} saved for {Customer}");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create a new invoice
        var invoice = new Invoice
        {
            InvoiceNo = 1,                                        // Set invoice number
            Customer = "John Doe",                                // Set customer name
            IssuedDate = new DateOnly(2023, 4, 1),                // Set issuance date
            Description = "Website Design",                       // Set invoice description
            Amount = 1000,                                       // Set invoice amount
            
            // Calculate tax based on the invoice amount and current tax rate
            Tax = invoice.Amount * GetCurrentTaxRate()
        };

        // Call the Save method to save the invoice
        invoice.Save();
    }

    // Method to get the current tax rate (replace with actual logic)
    static decimal GetCurrentTaxRate()
    {
        // Implement logic to get the current tax rate
        return 0.1m; // Example: 10% tax rate
    }
}

 ```    

 ## Changes made and why solution is good
 1. Error Correction: In the improved solution, the undeclared and uninitialized Amount variable is correctly accessed as invoice.Amount.
    Also, the CURRENT_TAX_RATE issue has been addressed by using the GetCurrentTaxRate method.
 2. Comments: The improved solution includes comments that explain the purpose and functionality of various parts of the code, 
    making it easier for developers to understand what the code is doing and why.
 3. Separation of Concerns: The improved solution separates concerns by defining a GetCurrentTaxRate method to calculate the tax rate. 
    This promotes a cleaner, more modular code structure. In contrast, the original code attempted to calculate the tax directly within the object initializer, 
    which can lead to less maintainable and harder-to-read code.
 4. Readability and Maintainability: The improved solution uses meaningful property names such as InvoiceNo, Customer, IssuedDate, etc., 
    and these properties are also commented to explain their purpose. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand for anyone reviewing or maintaining it.
 5. Encapsulation: The Invoice class encapsulates its properties, which means that they are private fields accessed through public properties. 
    This encapsulation allows for better control over the class's internal state and provides flexibility for adding validation or logic in the future 
    without affecting external code that uses the class.
