 # Documentation

This section is related to your work on clean code and documentation in week 5.

First, choose six rules of clean code and explain them. For each one,

* Summarise the rule in your own words.
* Provide an example from the code that you wrote in week 2 and then refined in week 4.
* Explain how your code implements the rule. 

Second, copy the doxygen comments from your code into your portfolio and provide some 
descriptive commentary on their purpose and structure. Use screenshots showing the HTML 
content that is generated from your code to illustrate your explanation.

Finally, highlight three examples from your code where you have eliminated the need
for comments by adhering to the principles of clean code.
 
 ## Rules of clean code 
 1) KISS - Which stands from keep it simple stupid. It is a rule in clean coding that suggests that code should be as simple as possible. It encourages programmers to avoid unnecessary complexity 
	       and make their code straightforward and easy to understand. In essence, it promotes simplicity over unnecessary complexity.Increase readability as code simple code is easier to read and understand.As there are few layers
		   of complexity the code is more acessible to other developers. Redused complexity often leads to lesser bugs. Easier to maintain as simple codebase enable faster modification and easier bug fixes.
		   Performance is also optimized as unnessary complexity is avoided. So code can be optimized effectively for performance. Results in faster excution.

 2) DRY - DRY, or "Don't Repeat Yourself," is a clean code principle that advises programmers to avoid duplicating code. Instead of writing the same logic or functionality in multiple places, 
          DRY encourages reusing code through functions, classes, or other abstractions. This reduces redundancy, makes code easier to maintain, and helps ensure consistency throughout a codebase.
 
 3) YAGNI - YAGNI, or "You Ain't Gonna Need It," is a clean code guideline that advises developers to avoid adding unnecessary features or functionality to their code. 
	        It encourages focusing only on the requirements at hand and not wasting time on features that might be needed in the future but are not currently necessary. 
			This helps keep the codebase simple and prevents overengineering.
 
 4) Clean code structure -  Organize your code logically with meaningful names, proper indentation, consistent formatting, and clear comments. This helps in improving code readability and understanding
	
 5) Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD) - Write tests for your code before or alongside the actual implementation. TDD encourages thorough testing and ensures that the code meets its requirements. 
	                                            Tests act as documentation and help identify issues early in the development process.
