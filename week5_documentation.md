 ## Rules of clean code 
 1) KISS - Which stands from keep it simple stupid. It is a rule in clean coding that suggests that code should be as simple as possible. It encourages programmers to avoid unnecessary complexity 
	       and make their code straightforward and easy to understand. In essence, it promotes simplicity over unnecessary complexity.

 2) DRY - DRY, or "Don't Repeat Yourself," is a clean code principle that advises programmers to avoid duplicating code. Instead of writing the same logic or functionality in multiple places, 
          DRY encourages reusing code through functions, classes, or other abstractions. This reduces redundancy, makes code easier to maintain, and helps ensure consistency throughout a codebase.
 
 3) YAGNI - YAGNI, or "You Ain't Gonna Need It," is a clean code guideline that advises developers to avoid adding unnecessary features or functionality to their code. 
	        It encourages focusing only on the requirements at hand and not wasting time on features that might be needed in the future but are not currently necessary. 
			This helps keep the codebase simple and prevents overengineering.
 
 4) Clean code structure -  Organize your code logically with meaningful names, proper indentation, consistent formatting, and clear comments. This helps in improving code readability and understanding
	
 5) Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD) - Write tests for your code before or alongside the actual implementation. TDD encourages thorough testing and ensures that the code meets its requirements. 
	                                            Tests act as documentation and help identify issues early in the development process.
