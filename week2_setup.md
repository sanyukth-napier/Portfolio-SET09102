## Environment configuration
This week we have have to setup Github and Visual Studio 22. The scenario/project we are working on in this semester will be using C# programming language and Microsoft Visual Studio 
as the IDE. GitHub wil be used as the version control system

## Creating a shared repository

To create a working repository in Github we have to first make a account on Github. We only need a working email address and a secure passoword and a username for a new account.
You can signup by clicking on this link  http://www.github.com/signup.

After creating a new account, the next thing to do is to make a new repository. Click on the "+" at hte top right to open the setup window.
Refer to the image below to see how to set up the repository.

3. Tick this the box to add a readme file

The click on the "Create repository" button at the bottom right
